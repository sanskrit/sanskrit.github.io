## No spam
No spam. Don't keep sending essentially the same message repeatedly in different threads. (BVP examples: [BVK's vAk yoga](https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/search?q=vAk%20yoga), [Achyut's mAheshwara sUtras](https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/search?q=Maheshwara%20sutras))

## Polite communication with a couple of caveats

- **"No first strike"** principle. If someone crosses the line, one should not be blamed for responding in the same manner (BVP example: ["haters"](https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/m0WsHOqu39M/m/Xmoxf0k9AAAJ)).
- One should be free to **harshly and clearly criticize ideas** - without getting to the person proposing them. No need to take this personally.

## Intro
- Hindu vidyA is an [email stream](https://groups.google.com/g/hindu-vidya/) to facilitate scholarship which aims to further Hindu interests. 
- Target engagement:
  - People who profess to further Hindu interests - whatever their views.
  - Other people - so long as they eschew anti-hindu activities here (in favor of areas of common interest).

### Why another mail stream?
- True, there are other email streams with similarly broad goals such as bhAratIya-vidvat-pariShat and Indology. But, as of this date, neither is explicitly pro hindu-interests, leading to some confusion and conflict (BVP examples: [goal clarity thread](https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/wcbrBGchR-E), [M Deshpande leaving BVP](https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/m0WsHOqu39M/m/d7ky6VRMAAAJ) ...) arising out of mismatched expectations. 
- Natural diversity in personality profiles and accepted norms lead to conflict and inefficiency in large groups (BVP Examples - [Unsuccessful demands](https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/m0WsHOqu39M/m/o_4SEVlVAAAJ) for expulsion of members, [complaints about "language"](https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/m0WsHOqu39M/m/cA7bwBJUAAAJ), [moderation and inconvenience](https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/Oa1JM_7ppE4/m/n9GxUBjfAAAJ) of members with certain codes for politeness).

## Posting rules
Polite communication with a couple of caveats:

- If someone crosses the line, one should not be blamed for responding in the same manner. ("No first strike" principle.)
- One should be free to harshly and clearly criticize bad ideas - without getting to the person proposing them. (There is no shortage of almost spam-level nonsensical posts by certain people where credibility is attached to the said idea merely by not being clearly opposed here.)

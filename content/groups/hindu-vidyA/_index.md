## Intro
- Hindu vidyA is an [email stream](https://groups.google.com/g/hindu-vidya/) to facilitate scholarship which aims to further Hindu interests. 
- Target engagement:
  - People who profess to further Hindu interests - whatever their views.
  - Other people - so long as they eschew anti-hindu activities here (in favor of areas of common interest).

### Why another mail stream?
- True, there are other email streams with similarly broad goals such as bhAratIya-vidvat-pariShat and Indology. But, as of this date, neither is explicitly pro hindu-interests, leading to some confusion and conflict (BVP examples: [goal clarity thread](https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/wcbrBGchR-E), [M Deshpande leaving BVP](https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/m0WsHOqu39M/m/d7ky6VRMAAAJ) ...) arising out of mismatched expectations. 
- Natural diversity in personality profiles and accepted norms lead to conflict and inefficiency in large groups (BVP Examples - Unsuccessful demands [1](https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/m0WsHOqu39M/m/o_4SEVlVAAAJ), [2](https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/n-E8zXKBnNM/m/Y3HwjYZqAAAJ) for expulsion of members, [complaints about "language"](https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/m0WsHOqu39M/m/cA7bwBJUAAAJ), [moderation and inconvenience](https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/Oa1JM_7ppE4/m/n9GxUBjfAAAJ) of members with certain codes for politeness, [burden of moderating large groups](https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/m0WsHOqu39M/m/eJIri-u7AwAJ)).

## Posting rules
No spam. Don't keep sending essentially the same message repeatedly in different threads. (BVP examples: [BVK's vAk yoga](https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/search?q=vAk%20yoga), [Achyut's mAheshwara sUtras](https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/search?q=Maheshwara%20sutras))

Polite communication with a couple of caveats:

- **"No first strike"** principle. If someone crosses the line, one should not be blamed for responding in the same manner (BVP example: ["haters"](https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/m0WsHOqu39M/m/Xmoxf0k9AAAJ)).
- One should be free to **harshly and clearly criticize ideas** - without getting to the person proposing them. No need to take this personally.

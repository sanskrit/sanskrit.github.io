## What?
We aim to freely (Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License) publish and distribute the popular and inspiring Kannada books as audio books on the internet.

### Copyright
- We will target classics which are out of copyright and in the public domain.
- For audio books uploaded prior to 2019-02-15, we had neglected to consider the copyright status - we will remove those books or keep them depending on whether we succeed at getting permissions from copyright-holders.

### Quality
These files are not to be considered "official" representatives of the corresponding books - just best-effort productions for the enjoyment of those who would *never* otherwise have read the corresponding books. ‡§è‡§§‡§æ ‡§ß‡•ç‡§µ‡§®‡§ø‡§∏‡§û‡•ç‡§ö‡§ø‡§ï‡§æ ‡§ó‡•ç‡§∞‡§®‡•ç‡§•‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø‡•å‡§™‡§ö‡§æ‡§∞‡§ø‡§ï‡§æ‡§É ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§§‡§ø‡§®‡§ø‡§ß‡§Ø ‡§á‡§§‡§ø ‡§®‡•§ For some people, reading the books directly might yield much greater enjoyment.

Though there are some flaws here and there (especially when it comes to reading sanskrit shloka-s, plus rare noises), it is overall a great boon, in my experience of listening to them during my long walks. The recordings were mechanically normalized, renamed according to chapter-title, sped up 1.5x and curated at the below locations. (Files are also available at 1x speed.)

## Where?
It is important to note that at any point in time, the output(in the form of audio files) of our efforts up to then will be available publicly and freely on the internet at archive.org. We will constantly publish a summary of project status online. So, connoiseurs will be able to enjoy the fruits of our labor even as the project progresses to increasingly higher levels of completion and quality.

## Contribute!

If you would like to contribute to this effort, or if you want to suggest books of similar calibre for future reading, please [let us know offline](https://github.com/sanskrit/issues/new). One doesn't need to be tech-savvy - and all one needs is some time for pleasure, discipline and a mobile phone with an internet connection for uploading (see [video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpwDrXkW1zo)). Even aged retired people have contributed recordings without any trouble.

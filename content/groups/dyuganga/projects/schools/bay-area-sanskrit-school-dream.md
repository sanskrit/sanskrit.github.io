## Motivation

We have all heard of (and some of us have visited) schools where:

- students are instructed in samskritam and hindu arts
- besides regular subjects like science, mathematics, english, history, social science etc..

Often, the medium of instruction is bilingual - Sanskrit for some topics (esp. humanities), English for others.



Benefits of such schools are as follows:

- Kids growing up in an environment filled with Indian culture is desirable - not just for their development, but also for the revival of bhAratIya samskriti.
- Samskrita, that unifying language that is at the core of classical hindu culture, (perhaps together with regional languages) and hindu arts -- if taught -- would provide such an environment.

## Long term plan: full fledged school

There is currently no such school in USA. Let us start one in the Bay area. 

### Why this will work?

- There is no shortage of students who would benefit from such a school.
- There is no shortage of teachers who can staff such a school.
- There is no shortage of parents who can pay for such a school.

### Positive examples.

- There [are 4 Chinese bilingual schools](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/samskritashaalaa_sf/J95YgrXlWkI) in the Bay area! And, 0 Indian bilingual schools.
- Hindu schools in USA.
    - [Maharshi School](http://www.maharishischooliowa.org/our-approach/vedic-science/sanskrit/) in IA.
    - [ISKCON's Synergy school](http://synergyinternationalschool.com/index.php/programs/11-programs/25-special-programs) in Seattle, WA area.
        - A similar school exists in the SF Bay area.
    - [http://3rfoundation.org](http://3rfoundation.org/) activities.
        - Hindu [high school in MA](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/samskritashaalaa_sf/LxV96ZH7gIY) (4 years): Includes Yoga, Sanskrit, Bharat natyam, ayurveda etc..
    - Jiddu Krishnamurti school in Ojai CA.
    - [Hindu University of America](http://www.hua.edu/ABOUT_US.PHP), Florida.
- We have also [seen videos](https://www.google.com/search?q=st+james+school&aq=f&oq=st+james+school&aqs=chrome.0.57j5j0l2j62l2.2695&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#q=st+james+school+sanskrit&hl=en&safe=off&source=univ&tbm=vid&tbo=u&sa=X&ei=EnwxUZ8X48eLAvSggMAF&ved=0CD4QqwQ&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&bvm=bv.43148975,d.cGE&fp=d3a63bc064d0c7f1&biw=1484&bih=870) of [St. James school](http://www.stjamesschools.co.uk/juniorschools/school-life.php?page=Academic&subsection=Languages) in UK where (mostly non Indian) students are taught samskrit \[please click on links to follow videos, I strongly encourage you to watch them\].

### Obstacles

What is lacking is:

- A groundswell of interest.
- A starting point and coordination.

## Intermediate plans: home-schooling co-op

- What is homeschooling? Read this [FAQ](http://californiahomeschool.net/howTo/faq.htm).


### Other potential directions

- Add Samskrtam classes in curricula of a local school.

## Participation

What can you do if you 

- I know it is a multi year project, as described [here](http://privateschool.about.com/cs/startingaschool/ht/startaschool.htm) and [here](http://www.wikihow.com/Start-a-School). But everything has to start somewhere. Please join this this [email list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/samskritashaalaa_sf).
- Please forward this web page to those who might be interested. Distribute widely. <--Important.

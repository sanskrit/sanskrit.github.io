## Recruitment
The main problem is recruitment/ marketing - H are not interested, and we are not (yet) good at it.

## Language
We're learning Spanish and Portuguese.

## Human resource quality
The human resource quality is generally poor -  
80s IQ population, like India.  
Yet, a creamy layer exists - mostly Euro and Levantine origin people - eg. nobel laureates of Argentina.

## Politics
The jAti-politics and quotas atleast would be thankfully missing! (Nayib Bukele, Alberto Fujimori etc. come to mind.)

From US to India - A common factor everywhere seems to be that people of particular jAti-s only are acceptable as rulers (at least under dumbocracy). So, the best that can be expected is that they aren't specially antagonistic to us. The Jews seem to follow this pattern.

## Corruption
Politicians and administration are quite corrupt.

## Religion
Evangelism is growing in Brazil.  
Generally, the grip of Christianity is weak; with good reception for gentle paganism.

## Crime
Crime is a big problem only in certain locales - as in parts of India.

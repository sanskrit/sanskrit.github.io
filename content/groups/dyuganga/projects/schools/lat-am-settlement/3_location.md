Soil in amazon basin - 

> The amazing thing is that the soil is as poor in nutrients as the vegetation is rich. The humus layer, which is that dark, organic stuff in the soil that develops when plants or animal matter break down, is minimal nearly everywhere. The soil in the Amazon rainforest is the poorest and most infertile in the world. If one cuts down the forest, it is irretrievably lost. The humus layer is quickly washed out. Three years after clearing the forest (at the latest, nothing will grow there. What remains is washed out, worthless soil. ... Most nutrients are absorbed by the plants and do not get into the soil at all.

### Assimilation and identity
#### Failures
> nietzsche's sister & brother in law founded an "aryan" colony in middle of paraguay in 1800's, it failed, most who remain are mixed. There was also a socialist aussie utopian community for goras founded there, similar story.

Japanese government sponsored colonies were established in paraguay etc.. Most descendents are Roman catholics now.

Forced assimilation:

> In March 1814, Francia imposed a law that no Spaniard may intermarry with another Spaniard, and that they may only wed mestizos, Amerindians, or Africans. This was done to eliminate any socioeconomic disparities along racial lines, and also to end the predominantly criollo and peninsulare influence in Paraguay. De Francia himself was not a mestizo, but feared that racial disparities would create tensions that could threaten his absolute rule.

Argentina's "black disappearance".

#### Successes
There's a thriving Welsh colony in Patagonia from the late 1800s. 

### Deciding Factors
(In decreasing order of priority)

- post-oil prosperity
  - arable land and water per capita
- social cohesion / crime rates; long term stability
- hindu-philia/misia levels (short and long term)
- avg local IQ (if descendents are to mix with locals)
- diseases - it would be good to avoid tropical disease load in the post-industrial world. eg. filaria ...
- current prosperity, accessiblity
- human friendly climate/ altitude
- expanse of the country - mountains, forests, desert, seas

### Rjrasva list
Looking at level of econ development + crime rates + long term stability the following would qualify: Uruguay, Chile, Argentina, Costa Rica, Panama, Brazil, & Peru.

You might also have to consider labor demand 20 yrs later based on current TFR's & several of these r ultra low TFR

### Land parameters
We seek land with the following qualities:

- should have good permanent water resources - eg. a river.
- If near the sea, it should be atleast 100m above sea-level, to avoid flooding.
- Should be fertile, allowing atleast 1500 acres (607 hectares) of farming; plus grazing land/ forest for goats/ sheep. If it has some forest patch, that would be good too.
- It should, with little effort, generate income to at least cover annual taxes and expenses without spoiling/ poisoning nature (ie. preferably without chemical fertilizers/ pesticides etc..).
- Crime rate should be low. Neighbors should be noble and intelligent.

We can invest about 1-1.5 million USD in the beginning.

## Paraguay
- Fertile eastern half. Abundant water (riverine and underground).
- Low taxes. No tax on foreign income. 
- Socially and economically conservative. Considered by folks from neighboring countries (also Americans, Europeans) as a "safe haven" to park their investments and futures.
- Recognizes "colonies" - Mennonite, Japanese etc.. colonies exist.

## Uruguay
- Most developed in South America.
- Afflicted by gender-wokeness!
- Many tourists and retirees. Relatively higher land cost.

## Argentina
- High inflation and poverty. Low fertility.
- Powerful visa.
- 300 sikhs there.

## Guyana
28% Hindu - jAti dissolved.  
Poor representation in army.

Nutrient poor soil. 

### Flooding
> "Guyana is most at risk to floods and droughts. Guyana has experienced many floods in recent years that are heavily influenced by La NiÃ±a events. The country's low-lying coastline, which in some areas is 2 m below sea level, causes flooding to be an imminent threat."

### Conflict
Also Indo-Guyanese have just recently undergone ethnic cleansing. Source: [TW](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AvCJLeb2LtNqzIJ6PhexXEmrZcSBFv39/view?usp=sharing)

#### Resource-richness
World power vying to destabilize and control.

## Suriname
Highly diverse, poor but rich in natural resources, somewhat high crime rates due to cartels.

## Peru
- Mennonite illegal land acquisition and deforestation [YT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBgA4EX65oM)

## Brazil

### Migration tips

HindI: [TW](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3JSnw2XK3Aw)


## Chile
> Chile doesn't have a lot of arable land compared to argentina but after uruguay it's the 2nd wealthiest in latin am, stable, & above all it has a lot of copper & other minerals. It is also more mestizo than argentina & uruguay which are more euro. Chilean passport is also the most powerful & citizenship is passed down all the way to grandkids, in most other countries only till your kids.

## Non latin american locations
Common question is: 

> Why Latin America? Why not elsewhere (eg. AUS, USA...)?

Common factor- they already have a viable hindu community there, lat-am doesn't -  
so good venue for derisking by diversification.

Particular factors

- USA - Higher population density, internal conflicts, wokeism, tougher immigration routes

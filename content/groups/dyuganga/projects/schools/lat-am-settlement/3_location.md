See intro section in [settlement-constitution](../settlement-constitution)

Soil in amazon basin - 

> The amazing thing is that the soil is as poor in nutrients as the vegetation is rich. The humus layer, which is that dark, organic stuff in the soil that develops when plants or animal matter break down, is minimal nearly everywhere. The soil in the Amazon rainforest is the poorest and most infertile in the world. If one cuts down the forest, it is irretrievably lost. The humus layer is quickly washed out. Three years after clearing the forest (at the latest, nothing will grow there. What remains is washed out, worthless soil. ... Most nutrients are absorbed by the plants and do not get into the soil at all.

### Assimilation and identity
Religious communities tend to hold on and succeed, while purely linguistic and racist ones don't.

#### Failures
> nietzsche's sister & brother in law founded an "aryan" colony in middle of paraguay in 1800's, it failed, most who remain are mixed. There was also a socialist aussie utopian community for goras founded there, similar story.

Japanese government sponsored colonies were established in paraguay etc.. Most descendents are Roman catholics now.

Forced assimilation:

> In March 1814, Francia imposed a law that no Spaniard may intermarry with another Spaniard, and that they may only wed mestizos, Amerindians, or Africans. This was done to eliminate any socioeconomic disparities along racial lines, and also to end the predominantly criollo and peninsulare influence in Paraguay. De Francia himself was not a mestizo, but feared that racial disparities would create tensions that could threaten his absolute rule.

Argentina's "black disappearance".

There was a thriving Welsh colony in Patagonia from the late 1800s - mostly assimilated now. 

#### Successes
Mennonite colonies in Paraguay, Peru etc.. 


### Deciding Factors
(In decreasing order of priority)

- post-oil prosperity
  - arable land and water per capita
- social cohesion / crime rates; long term stability
- hindu-philia/misia levels (short and long term)
- avg local IQ (if descendents are to mix with locals)
- diseases - it would be good to avoid tropical disease load in the post-industrial world. eg. filaria ...
- current prosperity, accessiblity
- human friendly climate/ altitude
- expanse of the country - mountains, forests, desert, seas

### Rjrasva list
Looking at level of econ development + crime rates + long term stability the following would qualify: Uruguay, Chile, Argentina, Costa Rica, Panama, Brazil, & Peru.

You might also have to consider labor demand 20 yrs later based on current TFR's & several of these r ultra low TFR

### Land parameters
We seek land with the following qualities:

- should have access to good permanent water resources (not requiring electricity) - eg. a river.
- If near the sea, it should be atleast 100m above sea-level, to avoid flooding.
- Should be fertile, allowing atleast 1500 acres (607 hectares) of farming; plus grazing land/ forest for goats/ sheep. If it has some forest patch, that would be good too.
- It should, with little effort, generate income to at least cover annual taxes and expenses without spoiling/ poisoning nature (ie. preferably without chemical fertilizers/ pesticides etc..).
- Crime rate should be low. Neighbors should be noble and intelligent.

We can invest about .5 million USD in the beginning.

### Movement, Citizenship
Citizens of member states of the Union of South American Nations (Mercosur) and its associate countries can travel without a visa or passport within the region. Mercosur member states include Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay, and its associate countries include Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. Together, these countries form an "area of free residence with the right to work" for all its citizens.

### Regional variations
Areas farther from cities tend to be lawless/ "strongest player rules" type.  
"Tri-Border Area" between Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay, with Ciudad del Este, Paraguay being the hub, is a bustling hive of traders and traffickers hawking products from around the world, from pirated DVDs to appliances to guns. A free-trade zone, it has a reputation as a hotbed of dodgy dealings and crime.

## Paraguay
- Fertile eastern half. Abundant water (riverine and underground).
- Low taxes. No tax on foreign income. 
- Socially and economically conservative. Considered by folks from neighboring countries (also Americans, Europeans) as a "safe haven" to park their investments and futures.
- Recognizes "colonies" - Mennonite, Japanese etc.. colonies exist.
- Hindus - small iskcon community is present.  

### Real estate tax
Real estate tax is levied annually at 1% of the fiscal value of the property, which is generally less than actual value (or market value). A tax rate of 0.5% applies if the area of rural property is smaller than five hectares and is used for agricultural or cattle ranching.  
In certain areas, an additional tax is levied on the fiscal value of vacant and semi-vacant land when the area of the built-up portion falls within certain determined percentage limits. 
Large tracts of land in rural areas are subject to an additional tax determined on a percentage basis and to a proportional tax of 0.5% to 1% on the fiscal value of tracts with areas ranging from 10,000 to 60,000 or more hectares.

The 1992 Paraguayan Constitution established that municipalities and departments are entitled to the tax revenues directly related to real estate. Collection of these taxes is the responsibility of municipal governments.

## Uruguay
- Most developed in South America.
- Afflicted by gender-wokeness!
- Many tourists and retirees. Relatively higher land cost.
- Hindus - hastinapura foundation is active. may have a small iskcon community.

## Argentina
- High inflation and poverty. Low fertility.
- Powerful visa.
- Hindus 
  - hastinapura foundation is active. 
  - may have a small iskcon community.
- 300 sikhs there.

> keep this list in mind if you’re planning to settle in the interior: arsenic is mainly found in groundwater (wells) in the following provinces: buenos aires (north of the province, salado river basin), chaco (near the paraná river), formosa (rural areas, eastern region), santa fe (central and northern areas, near salado and paraná rivers), santiago del estero (north and west), tucumán (north), salta (rural areas, near rivers), catamarca (west, pre-andes), la rioja (rural areas in the west), jujuy (north and west), mendoza (west, rural areas), san juan (rural areas), córdoba (north and center, near suquía river), río negro (southern rural areas), neuquén (rural areas near rivers and aquifers), la pampa (northern rural areas), misiones (northeastern rural areas).


## Guyana
28% Hindu - jAti mostly dissolved.  
Poor representation in army.

Nutrient poor soil. 

### Flooding
> "Guyana is most at risk to floods and droughts. Guyana has experienced many floods in recent years that are heavily influenced by La Niña events. The country's low-lying coastline, which in some areas is 2 m below sea level, causes flooding to be an imminent threat."

### Conflict
Also Indo-Guyanese have just recently undergone ethnic cleansing. Source: [TW](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AvCJLeb2LtNqzIJ6PhexXEmrZcSBFv39/view?usp=sharing)

#### Resource-richness
World power vying to destabilize and control.

## Suriname
Highly diverse, poor but rich in natural resources, somewhat high crime rates due to cartels.

## Peru
- Mennonite illegal land acquisition and deforestation [YT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBgA4EX65oM)

## Brazil

### Hindu-philia
- Petropolis has a sanskrit speaking advaitin teacher Jonas's retreat center Vishva Vidya Institute of Vedanta, Sanskrit, Mantras and Vedic Culture.
- AchArya sthAneshvara has a good following near sao paolo.


### Hindu-phobia
Brazil is 30% evangelical, 50% Catholic.

Narco-pentecostalism in Brazil - A gang in Rio rules 100,000 people, enforces evangelicalism (2024). Rio’s ‘narco-pentecostal’ gangsters accused of ordering Catholic churches to close. The gang boss is called Peixão (Big Fish), after the Jesus fish. [TW](https://x.com/whyvert/status/1811263946201907565)

Further the society is fractured in Brazil (whites vs blacks vs amerindians, catholics vs evangelists, gangesters ...)
More homogenous countries to the south don't have that problem.  
Even rich Brazilians and Argentinians buy property in Paraguay as a "safe-haven".

### Migration tips

HindI: [TW](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3JSnw2XK3Aw)


## Chile
> Chile doesn't have a lot of arable land compared to argentina but after uruguay it's the 2nd wealthiest in latin am, stable, & above all it has a lot of copper & other minerals. It is also more mestizo than argentina & uruguay which are more euro. Chilean passport is also the most powerful & citizenship is passed down all the way to grandkids, in most other countries only till your kids.

## Non latin american locations
Common question is: 

> Why Latin America? Why not elsewhere (eg. AUS, USA...)?

Common factor- they already have a viable hindu community there, lat-am doesn't -  
so good venue for derisking by diversification.

Particular factors

- USA - Higher population density, internal conflicts, wokeism, tougher immigration routes

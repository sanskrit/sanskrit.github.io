title = "2 Recruitment"

## Target
### Profile
- We seek Hindu families  
  who are firmly committed to retaining their saMskAra-s, knowledge (traditional & modern) across generations;  
  who "do the math" and conclude that modern industrial society will not last, for the most part, beyond a few generations.  
- They should agree with the settlement [constitution](../constitution]).
  - Particularly, they should be willing to (eventually) switch over to Sanskrit - atleast for formal communication.
  - Of course, they should (gradually) learn the language of the surrounding people (eg. Spanish). 

### Number
Shooting for 500 families.

If founder size is not sufficient, colony is almost certain to fail in it's "conservative" goals. If too short:

- One is left with countries (eg. suriname) with decent preexisting H population; but with worse geography.
- Recruitment of modernist quasi-christian locals is unlikely to succeed without strong ISKCON like missionary activity (if then) - just scholarship won't suffice.

## Strategy
Rough sequence -

- send pioneer
- buy big piece of land;
- divide into house plots, small farm plots, common grazing ground.
- build house + hostel with class rooms with toilets and common kitchen
- get the farm running
- offer house + farm plots to qualified H (theoretically "faculty")  
  for "volunteer/ very cheap lease while you try",  
  ending in sale and settlement (preferably as local citizens)
- attract students

### maThas
If we can attract maTha-s of various sampradAya-s to co-locate - say near hastinApur, argentina - that could attract the "right crowds". That's all we need expect from them.

Potentials:

- suguNendra tIrtha
- https://www.ramanujamission.org/introduction/sri-ramanuja-mission-usa/
- chinna jIyar
- ramakrishna mission
- iskcon

namaH!  
Are you interested in this project  
to establish an agrarian traditional Hindu settlement and school somewhere in Latin America,  
where they can preserve, practice and propagate, alongside modern science, Hindu religion and arts (classical music, dance, rituals, meditations...) in peace  
even as the industrial society collapses when fossil fuels run out, with unrest being more severe in the old world. - https://rebrand.ly/lat-am ?

If not, you can mention it to compatible Hindus on the "conservative" spectrum.

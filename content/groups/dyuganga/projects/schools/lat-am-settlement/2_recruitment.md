title = "2 Recruitment"

## Target
### Profile
- We seek Hindu families who are firmly committed to retaining their saMskAra-s and traditional knowledge across generations.  
- They should agree with the settlement [constitution](../constitution]).
  - Particularly, they should be willing to (eventually) switch over to Sanskrit - atleast for formal communication.

### Number
Shooting for 500 families.

If founder size is not sufficient, colony is almost certain to fail in it's "conservative" goals. If too short:

- One is left with countries (eg. suriname) with decent preexisting H population.
- Recruitment of modernist quasi-christian locals is unlikely to succeed without strong ISKCON like missionary activity (if then) - just scholarship won't suffice.

## Strategy
Rough sequence -

- send pioneer
- buy big piece of land;
- divide into house plots, small farm plots, common grazing ground.
- build house + hostel with class rooms with toilets and common kitchen
- get the farm running
- offer house + farm plots to qualified H (theoretically "faculty")  
  for "volunteer/ very cheap lease while you try",  
  ending in sale and settlement
- attract students

### maThas
If we can attract maTha-s of various sampradAya-s to co-locate - say near hastinApur, argentina - that could attract the "right crowds". That's all we need expect from them.

title = "+Latin Am Settlement"
+++

## Intro
Some young families want to (ultimately) establish an agrarian traditional Hindu university and settlement somewhere in Latin America;  
where they can preserve, practice and propagate Hindu religion and arts (classical Hindu music, dance, rituals, meditations...) in peace  
even as the industrial society collapses when fossil fuels run out, with unrest being more severe in the old world.

title = "+Latin Am Settlement"
+++


## Intro
Some young families want to (ultimately) establish an agrarian traditional Hindu settlement and school somewhere in Latin America;  
where they can preserve, practice and propagate, alongside modern science, Hindu religion and arts (classical music, dance, rituals, meditations...) in peace  
even as the industrial society collapses when fossil fuels run out, with unrest being more severe in the old world.

This center in Latin America for Hindu studies  
will also benefit locals and Hindu expat communities.

## पृष्ठभूमिका Background
- India
  - dense population. Famine + war looming post-oil-collapse (150 yrs, +100 if ice methane works). (Ref- [Murphy](https://escholarship.org/uc/energy_ambitions) )
  - ब्रह्म-द्विट्-प्रभुत्वम्, jAti-woke-ism, sickular government.
  - Suboptimal to "put all eggs in one basket".
- Latin America
  - Low population density, plenty land+water.
  - Locals look like us - so less conflict (though it will be there).

The population/ resource density difference is stark.

The alternative is to convince dvija-s to transition to Indian villages soon and prepare (also being [encouraged](https://rebrand.ly/grAma-dvija)). When famine hits, they'll be in a worse (though not hopeless) position relative to new-worlders - lands and harvest snatched, jihadists and bandits etc..

## Contribution
Anyone may freely use those and anything else we've collected.

- One may in turn share any texts or manuals he collects so as to be similarly preserved/ distributed.
- Or, one may volunteer labor to proofread such texts, if equipped with time, a computer and ability.

## Related projects
Some of our proofreading/ publication efforts target other areas. (Eg. [kalpa-texts](/groups/dyuganga/projects/text/proofreading/kalpa-texts/), [tattva-texts](/groups/dyuganga/projects/text/proofreading/tattva-texts/), [kAvya-texts](/groups/dyuganga/projects/text/proofreading/kAvya-texts/), vyAkaraNa)

I'm also interested in arranging for long-term (millennium scale) text preservation even for the coming post industrial era - https://rebrand.ly/dg-archive . But no traction - since the right technology (which exists) / interest is not at hand. If you know some one interested in such please connect.

title = "mahAbhArata gItA press - present with audio"
+++

## Status
Completed in early 2022.

### Sonsors
- (1L Rs) from Aditi Bannerjee via Indic academy.

## Goal
Digitize and present the text of the mahAbhArata edition so laboriously and wonderfully recorded as part of this project - together with the audio. The text will (just like our audio files) be made available for free in markdown format - anyone can copy and reuse. Examples of such text with audio presentations:



- rAmAyaNa eg. [001_sanxepa/](https://vishvAsa.github.io/rAmAyaNam/vAlmIkIyam/)
- raghuvaMsha eg. [raghuvaMsham/01/](https://vishvasa.github.io/kAvyam/laxyam/padyam/kAlidAsaH/raghuvaMsham/sarva-prastutiH/01/)
- kumArasambhava eg. [kumArasambhavam/02/](https://vishvasa.github.io/kAvyam/laxyam/padyam/kAlidAsaH/kumArasambhavam/sarva-prastutiH/01_umotpattiH/)
- durgA saptashatI - eg. [prathama-charitam/](https://vishvasa.github.io/purANam/mArkaNDeya-purANam/durgA-saptashatI/sarva-prastutiH/03_durgAsaptashatI/01_madhu-kaiTabha-vadhaH/)
- rAmacharitamAnasa - eg. [02_ayodhyAkANDa/](https://vishvAsa.github.io/kAvyam/TIkA/padyam/purANam/rAmacharitamAnasa-TIkA/02_ayodhyAkANDa/)
- nArAyaNIyam eg. [/nArAyaNIyam/003/](https://vishvAsa.github.io/kAvyam/TIkA/padyam/purANam/nArAyaNIyam/003/)
- several sAmans etc..

## Estimated cost
I'll get it done by a learned gentleman I've been employing for much of the past year (for fixing taittirIya saMhitA commentary and such). He's very capable (I will supervise). I pay him by the hour \- I can keep track of the time he spends and let you know - so that you can transfer the money directly. Off the top of my head, I estimate that it will him a month or two to accomplish the task (utilizing OCR, other digitized versions of the text).

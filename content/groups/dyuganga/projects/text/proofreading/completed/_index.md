ALERT: This sampling is NOT an exhaustive list of completed projects. Our main focus is on making texts available, checking them and so on - so we're unable to maintain such an exhaustive list.

I usually (but not always) announce completed projects in relevant mail streams such as [hindu-vidya](https://groups.google.com/g/hindu-vidyA) or [dyuganga](https://groups.google.com/g/dyuganga) or [kalpa-prayoga](https://groups.google.com/g/kalpa-prayoga) etc.. 

However, almost all works we digitize, along with those digitized by others (usually with plentiful corrections and presentation improvements from our end), is published under creative commons license on various websites we maintain, such as those in the following subdomains of https://vishvasa.github.io/ :

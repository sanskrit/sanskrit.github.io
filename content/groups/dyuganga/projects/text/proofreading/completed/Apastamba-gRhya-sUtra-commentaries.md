## Proposed work

I wanted to get typed AnAkulA and tAtparyadarshanI commentaries to Apastamba gRhyasUtra to an  error-free state. The pdf is available on [archive.org](https://archive.org/stream/APASTHAMBAGRUHYASUTRAMSUDARSHANAHARADATHA/APASTHAMBA%20GRUHYASUTRAM%20%28SUDARSHANA%2CHARADATHA%29#page/n31/mode/2up). Well, it was typed up by someone a long time ago (and I had published it in [wikisource a long time ago](https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%B8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AC_%E0%A4%97%E0%A5%83%E0%A4%B9%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%B8%E0%A5%82%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A3%E0%A4%BF,_%E0%A4%B9%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%B8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AF_%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%82%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%BE,_%E0%A4%B8%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B6%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%B8%E0%A5%82%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%83_%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B6%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%8D_%E0%A4%9A)), but that version has many errors and that makes it irritating to read. In the end, it will be presented like this: [https://vishvAsa.github.io/vedAH/taittirIyam/sUtram/ApastambaH/gRhyam/TIkA/17_07/](https://vishvAsa.github.io/vedAH/taittirIyam/sUtram/ApastambaH/gRhyam/TIkA/17_07/)  (besides the [plain text markdown](https://github.com/vvasuki/vedAH/blob/master/content/taittirIyam/sUtram/ApastambaH/gRhyam/TIkA/17_07.md)), and needless to say - anyone will be welcome to access, use, copy, publish it however they like.



## Estimated cost
I'll get it done by a learned gentleman I've been employing for much of the past year (for fixing taittirIya saMhitA commentary and such). He's very capable (I will supervise). I pay him by the hour (x Rs) \- I was wondering if you could foot the bill for this work. I can keep track of the time he spends and let you know - so that you can transfer the money directly. Off the top of my head, I estimate that it will him a month to accomplish the task - that comes to about 40k Rs.



## Past experience / examples:  
- [https://vishvAsa.github.io/vedAH/taittirIyam/sUtram/hiraNyakeshI/paddhatiH/saMskAraratnamAlA/](https://vishvAsa.github.io/vedAH/taittirIyam/sUtram/hiraNyakeshI/paddhatiH/saMskAraratnamAlA/)  \- saMskAraratnamAlA, an excellent KYV paddhati text especially popular in mahArAShTra (albeit belonging to the closely related hiraNyakeshI sUtra). This was executed by saMskRtabhAratI people (at their expense) after I suggested the text to them.
- Ongoing work pertaining to SC Vasu's commentary on aShTAdhyAyI ( example [here](https://ashtadhyayi.github.io/sutra-details/?sutra=1.1.6) ), sponsored by shrI nIlesh of [ashyadhyayi.com](http://ashyadhyayi.com) .



## Importance of the work
I frequently refer to it for planning saMskAra-s in my household, and presumably it will similarly be the case for a good majority of south Indian brAhmaNas. Flowing text will be far better than pdfs or physical books.

{{< figure src="/groups/dyuganga/projects/text/git-workflow/vscode/images/new-folder-creation.jpg" title="" class="thumbnail">}}

- Within an image subfolder (create one if needed, using right-click on the parent folder/ directory), save the image to be included (screenshot using a tool like flameshot.org if needed) with an appropriate name like rAmAnuja.png . 
  - If that's not possible, please send the image file via telegram. 

- Then apply a tag like (where FULL_IMAGE_FILE_NAME is replaced by the actual file name you used for the corresponding image):

```
![](../images/FULL_IMAGE_FILE_NAME)
```

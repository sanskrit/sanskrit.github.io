## Contribution levels
Our expectation: when we read the corrected text, we expect to have atleast the same experience as reading the original pdf (if not better). <u>Even otherwise, if you leave the text in a significantly better state than earlier, it is valuable.</u>

- Top level: Perfect text and formatting.
- Next level: Perfect text, with basic formatting (described below). Reader won't feel particular urge to consult the source most of the time.
- Next level: Almost perfect text (possibly missing diacritics and accents), with basic formatting (contiguous paragraphs, footnotes etc.).
- And so on.

## Typing correct symbols
- Please use the correct symbols. Common mistakes: |(pipe) instead of ।(daNDa), :(colon) instead of visarga(ः).

### Special characters
If you cannot type unusual unicode characters, copy them from here and paste.

- IAST diacritics
  - ā Ā ī Ī ū Ū ṛ Ṛ ṝ Ṝ ḷ	Ḷ ḹ	Ḹ
  - ṃ Ṃ ḥ Ḥ
  - ṅ  Ṅ ñ Ñ
  - ṭ Ṭ ḍ Ḍ
  - ś Ś ṣ Ṣ
- ISO
  - ē ō r̥ r̥̄ l̥ l̥̄ ṁ
- Vedic Svaras
  - `  ॒   ॑ `

- No harm using ISO instead of IAST - we can fix it later.
- No harm ignoring initial letter capitalization (ie ṣ instead of Ṣ and so on).


## Things to ignore
- Quotation mark placement which is not ‘bad’ as described in examples above - ie. don’t spend time trying to make it ‘best’.
- Empty spaces in lines. Don’t spend time correcting [spaces like this](https://i.imgur.com/On0RioK.png).

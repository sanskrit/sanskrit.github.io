## Maximal alignment preference

Let there be 3 or even more recensions of the core text -  
in the gold-standard source,  
they should be aligned with each other _and_ with the commentaries to the extant possible,  
as shown in the SB case.

- Replicating 3 diferrent copies of commentaries would mean that every typo would be corrected in 3 places, which is not resilient.
- Readers, while preferring a particular pATha,  would be interested in easily referring to other pATha-s as well.

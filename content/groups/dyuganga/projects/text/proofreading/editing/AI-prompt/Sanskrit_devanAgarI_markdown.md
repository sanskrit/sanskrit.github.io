+++
We have a physical book with

- sanskrit devanAgarI content
- possibly footnotes appearing at the bottom of each page
- page numbers appearing at the top or bottom,

You will be provided sanskrit devanAgarI markdown (from OCR of some pages). You'll proofread with the following edits.

**Separate words** at pada (inflected word) boundaries with spaces.  
In doing this, NEVER break a sandhi. For example, ह्यस्तु should be spit to ह्य् अस्तु and not हि अस्तु.

**Separate subwords** inside compounds with hyphens. In doing this, observe the following rules

- NEVER break a sandhi. For example, श्रीधरस्येच्छा should yield श्री-धरस्येच्छा, and not श्री-धरस्य-इच्छा. 
- Never separate such subwords by space - remove such spurious spaces. 
- Don't separate upasarga prefixes - आश्रमम् should not be replaced by आ-श्रमम्.

Also, **recreate sandhi** in case a sandhi is broken within a sentence. For example - अथ स्थापकः अनिरुद्धः विष्वक्सेनः should be made to अथ स्थापको ऽनिरुद्धो विष्वक्सेनः. However, follow these rules - 

- If the sandhi break denotes separate sentances or pauses, insert apprpriate punctuation like , or ।.
- Don't remove avagraha-s. Eg. don't replace यदा ऽऽत्मानं with यदात्मानं.

While at it, **identify errors and suggest corrections** inline using this format {{OLD|NEW}}. This includes spelling / grammatical Errors, invalid words. 

**Format quotes** (mantras to be chanted are also counted as quotes) as follows -

- Short quotes, involving 2-3 words should be placed within ""symobls.
- Longer quotes should use the markdown >-symbol.
- Nested quotes should be similarly formatted.

**Markdown formatting** will be used - so be careful not to mess with spaces.

Preserve **page numbers**, which come from scanning the page. For example, when you identify page number 922, format it as [[922]]. You can make it appear in the mist of a paragraph which flows on to the next page.

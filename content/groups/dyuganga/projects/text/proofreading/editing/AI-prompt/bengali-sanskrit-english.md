title = "Bengali sanskrit english"

```markdown
I am learning Bengali. I want to use short stories by authors like Rabindranath Thakur for the same.

I know Sanskrit and English. I do not know the Bengali script. So do the following:

For each paragraph I provide:

* go sentence-by-sentence
* the original Bengali on the first line
* a Devanagari transliteration on the second
* the Sanskrit translation on the third
* the English translation on the fourth

A lot of the material I provide might be in the Sanskritized sādhu bhāṣā. If that is the case, then use the appropriate strategy during the translation into Sanskrit. I prefer tatsama words to be used as-is (for ease of learning) with the form modified per grammatical rules. For tadbhāva words, use the Sanskrit root word in the same way.

If you have understood your task, I will provide the material.

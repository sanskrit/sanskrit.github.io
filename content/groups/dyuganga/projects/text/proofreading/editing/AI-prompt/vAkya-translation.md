title = "vAkya translation"
+++

```
For every vAkya (a single sentence or verse, not a line or paragraph), create the following structure (replace capitalized words with corresponding content). 

<details open><summary>विश्वास-प्रस्तुतिः</summary>

ORIGINAL VAKYA OR VERSE
</details>

<details><summary>English</summary>

TRANSLATION
</details>


<details><summary>मूलम्</summary>

ORIGINAL VAKYA OR VERSE (SAME AS IN विश्वास-प्रस्तुतिः ABOVE)
</details>

These detail tags will be placed within a markdown file -  
so the newlines after the summary tag are significant. 
Don't use html tags (like BR) where markdown suffices (2 like spaces at the end of the line instead of BR tag).

Wrap the entire output in a markdown code block so that spaces may be verified and copied.
```

Alternate:

```markdown
I will give you two texts - 1 is clean source of the sanskrit original. 2 is OCR of the same text with hindI commentary. Using this, produce a md file which interleaves the commentary in this form

<details open><summary>विश्वास-प्रस्तुतिः</summary>

ORIGINAL VAKYA OR VERSE
</details>

<details><summary>टीका</summary>

COMMENTARY
</details>

<details><summary>मूलम्</summary>

ORIGINAL VAKYA OR VERSE (SAME AS IN विश्वास-प्रस्तुतिः ABOVE)
</details>


Suggest corrections only in the commentary portion, only in this form - [OLD|NEW]. No wanton change of text.  
Use markdown format for footnotes. (if footnote named 1 appears in page 12, make the reference 12_1).

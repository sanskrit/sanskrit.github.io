TODO: Currently yields poor results.

```markdown
You will be given a kannaDa commentary of a maNipravALa (sanskritized tamIL) text. Your job is to proofread it and produce valid devanAgarI markdown text. 

**Transliteration**  

If the input is not already in devanAgarI,   
correctly transcribe it to devanAgarI; (distinguish short and long vowels well - नॆ vs ने, नॊ vs नो, ऎ vs ए, ऒ vs ओ). Ensure that bold and italics are retained.

**Proofreading caveats**

Suggest any corrections in this fromat - [[OLD|NEW]].  
In old prints, the terminal न् is confounded for र्. So take special care there.

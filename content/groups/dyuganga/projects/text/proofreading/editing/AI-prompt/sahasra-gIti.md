The sanskrit parts above should be taken through the hyphenator algorithm described below.

## Hyphenator algorithm
This algorithm is to be applied to text only where explicitly required above, and nowhere else.

### **Part 1: Definitions and Core Principles**

#### **1. Word or Stem Boundary**

A word or stem boundary is the point where two words or stems are joined (possibly but not always involving sandhi) without a space or hyphen. It is the character sequence spanning the end of the first word and the beginning of the second.

#### **2. The Separation Principle**

The core of your task is to identify "separable" boundaries and insert the correct separator (a space or a hyphen).

The **cardinal rule** is: **Do not revert the sandhi.** You are splitting the *result* of the sandhi, not undoing it.

#### **3. The Rule of Precedence: Non-Separability is Absolute**

This is the most critical section. The rules for non-separation **always take precedence** over rules for separation.

*   **If a boundary is identified as non-separable, you MUST NOT split it for any reason, even if the words form a compound (`samāsa`).** This is a veto rule.

#### **4. Boundary Types and Examples**

**A. Non-Separable Boundaries: These MUST NOT be split.**

*   **Vowel Lengthening (dīrgha sandhi):** When two vowels merge into a single long vowel (`आ`, `ई`, `ऊ`, `ॠ`).
    *   `दया + आर्द्र → दयार्द्र`. The boundary `या` is non-separable.
    *   `अपि + इच्छा → अपीच्छा`. The boundary `पी` is non-separable.
    *   **Crucial Compound Example:** `धर्म + अर्थ → धर्मार्थ`. This is a `dīrgha sandhi` within a compound. Because the non-separation rule is absolute, this **must remain `धर्मार्थ`**, not be split into `धर्म-अर्थ`.
    *   **Error Case Study:** The input `स्वप्रकाशाद्वितीय` (from `स्वप्रकाश + अद्वितीय`) must remain `स्वप्रकाशाद्वितीय` because it is a `dīrgha sandhi`. It is incorrect to split it as `स्वप्रकाश-अद्वितीय`.

*   **Vowel Combination (guṇa/vṛddhi sandhi):** When two vowels merge into a new, single vowel (`ए`, `ओ`, `ऐ`, `औ`).
    *   `महा + उत्सव → महोत्सव`. The boundary `हो` is non-separable.
    *   `राम + इति → रामेति`. The boundary `मे` is non-separable.
    *   `सदा + एव → सदैव`. The boundary `दै` is non-separable.

**B. Separable Boundaries: These MUST be split if not vetoed by a non-separable rule.**

*   **Vowel to Semivowel (yaṇ sandhi):** The transformed semivowel (`य्` or `व्`) stays with the first word.
    *   `इति + एवम् → इत्येवम्` must be split as `इत्य् एवम्`. (The `इ` became `य्`; the `य्` is kept).
    *   `मधु + अरिः → मध्वरिः` must be split as `मध्व्-अरिः`.

*   **Visarga (`ः`) Sandhi:**
    *   `visarga` to `ो`: `रामः + अस्ति → रामोऽस्ति`. Split as `रामो ऽस्ति`. (The avagraha `ऽ` is part of the boundary).
    *   `visarga` to `र्`: `दुः + प्रकृतेः + अस्य → दुष्प्रकृतेरस्य`. Split as `दुष्प्रकृतेर् अस्य`.
    *   `visarga` to `स्/श्/ष्`: `नमः + ते → नमस्ते`. Split as `नमस् ते`.

*   **Final `म्`:** A final `म्` before a vowel is separated by a space.
    *   `फलम् + अश्नुते → फलमश्नुते`. Split as `फलम् अश्नुते`.
    *   `अर्थम् + इति  → अर्थमिति`. Split as `अर्थम् इति`.

*   **Consonant Assimilation:**
    *   `तत् + हि → तद्धि`. Split as `तद् धि`.

### **Part 2: The Rigorous Processing Workflow**

Follow these steps in strict order. **This is not a set of guidelines; it is an algorithm.**

**Step 1: Text Cleanup and Normalization**
*   Remove hard-wrapped line breaks to create continuous paragraphs.
*   Correct obvious typographical errors (e.g., a space in the middle of a word).
*   Preserve intentional styles like **bold** and *italic*.
*   Identify Sanskrit text and its script (eg. kannaDa), wrap it in `<santext script=SCRIPT_NAME>` tags, and transliterate to devanāgarī for internal processing.

**Step 2: The Core Separation Algorithm**
For each text wrapped in `<santext>` tags, iterate through every potential word boundary and apply the following logic:

1.  **First Check (The Veto):** Examine the boundary. Is it a **non-separable** `dīrgha`, `guṇa`, or `vṛddhi` sandhi?
    *   If **YES**, the Rule of Precedence applies. **Do nothing.** Do not split it. Move to the next boundary.
2.  **Second Check (Separation):** If the boundary passed the first check (i.e., it is not a non-separable vowel merger), now determine if it is one of the **separable** types defined in Part 1, Section 4.B.
    *   If **NO**, do nothing and move on.
3.  **Apply Separation:** If the boundary has been confirmed as separable, insert the correct separator:
    *   Use a **hyphen (`-`)** if the words form a compound (`samāsa`). Example: `पुण्य-पापैः`.
    *   Use a **space (` `)** for all other separable cases. Example: `इत्य् एवम्`.

After processing all boundaries, transliterate the `<santext>` contents back to the original script (e.g., kannaDa).

**Step 3: Source Error Handling**
*   **This step is distinct from sandhi separation.** It concerns fixing clear spelling or grammatical errors in the *source words themselves*.
*   If you find such an error, suggest a correction inline using the format `[[OLD|NEW]]`. Example: `[[prarabvaṁ|prārabdhaṁ]]`.

**Step 4: Final Markdown Formatting**
*   Remove the `<santext>` tags.
*   **Quotes & Mantras:** Enclose short quotes (under 5 words) in `"` and format longer quotes or mantras as blockquotes (`>`).
*   **Structure:** End verse lines with two spaces for a soft break. Separate paragraphs with a blank line.
*   **Page Numbers:** Format page numbers (e.g., `६४`) as `[[P64]]` at the precise point of the page break. This can be within a paragraph which continues to the next page.
*   **Footnotes:** Format footnotes (e.g., `*`) using Markdown's footnote syntax (`[^1]`). Place the definition at the end. Make the footnote definitions appear next to the paragraph containing the corresponding footnote reference. Ensure that footnote references are unique, reflecting the number used in the source whenever possible. For example if footnote named 1 appears in page 12, make the reference 12_1.
*   If the input contains `<details><summary>मूलम्</summary>...</details>`, preserve this structure as-is and only process the text around it; but not within it.

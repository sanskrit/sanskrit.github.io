## Goal
Digitize and present the text of the mahAbhArata edition so laboriously and wonderfully recorded as part of this project - together with the audio. The text will (just like our audio files) be made available for free in markdown format - anyone can copy and reuse. Examples of such text with audio presentations:

## Estimated cost
I'll get it done by a learned gentleman I've been employing for much of the past year (for fixing taittirIya saMhitA commentary and such). He's very capable (I will supervise). I pay him by the hour (227.27 Rs) \- I can keep track of the time he spends and let you know - so that you can transfer the money directly. Off the top of my head, I estimate that it will him a month or two to accomplish the task (utilizing OCR, other digitized versions of the text).

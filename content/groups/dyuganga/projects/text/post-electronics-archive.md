## Intro
**How to best preserve our knowledge (physical and spiritual) and texts?**

We propose a network of archives spread over multiple regions,  
where copies of all texts relevant to Hindus are preserved  
in media which will persist for millennia.  
The archived material should be readable with minimal technology,  
to allow for regression technical abilities due to loss of knowledge, lack of materials, wars and such.

The archive and media used for preserving books should resist degradation and destruction due to factors such as

- Vandalism and arson
- Human greed for material ("Let me melt these plates and make a knife")
- Natural chemical degradation
- Insects, rodents and pests
- Earthquakes

Similar efforts include 

- Memory of mankind ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_of_Mankind))
- The Long now foundation's Rosetta Nickel Disks ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Project))

## Possible media
Longevity of several media, ranging from paper to stone, is surveyed in this ["knowledge preservation" webpage](https://vishvasa.github.io/notes/backup/knowledge-preservation).

Currently, the most promising media for storing images of pages or plain text are:

- High quality ceramic tiles
- Nickel Disk

## Text collection
Number of published texts we want to save is in 100000s.  
Even if, in the beginning stages, we pick the most important ones, it might be 10000. Of these we'd need 10 copies to store in different locations.

To help form a plan, consider the first 600pg book in this [bhAgavata-commentary series](https://archive.org/details/bhagavatam-multi-commentary/Srimad%20Bhagavata%20Mahapuranam%20Skandha%2001/page/258/mode/2up). There are roughly 1380 letters (e.g. व्या · ख्या · न · च · तु · ष्ट · य · वि · शि · ष्ट · म्) and 380 spaces in a typical page from the book linked earlier (counted using https://aksharas.vipran.in ).

How many tablets would it need - at minimum resolution (requiring 10x magnification) and at naked-eye visible resolution?

## Preservation need
Human brain is limited - so important texts need to be preserved.  
For example:

- rAmANuja had to trek all the way to kAshmIr to consult bodhAyana-vRtti, 
- deshika had to carry a big trunk of palm leaves to save shruta-prakAshika etc.., while fleeing Islamic invasion of shrIrangam. 
- Even a text published by so famous a person as uttamUru-svAmI 50 years ago is very hard to find.

Examples of catastrophic loss -

- The last classical antique library in Constantinople burnt down in the 5th century and 120000 codices with it. The first medieval library of the 6th century contained about 100 books.
- Burnt libraries of nAlandA, Alexandria.

## Why digitize?

- Want to easily search for the source of that amazing shloka someone mentioned?
- Want to look up a certain term in (say) the abhyankar grammar dictionary on your phone?
- Want to read flowing text comfortably on your tablet on phone? Want your annotations to be safe for ever? (See advantages described below)
- Want to carry an entire library on your tablet?
- Want your phone to read out a certain text?
- Dream of a richer sanskrit wikipedia, wikisource etc..?

### Ebook Advantages

फलकादिषु जङ्गमयन्त्रेषु संस्कृतपुस्तकपठनं मे ऽतिरोचते। उदाहरणमत्र वीक्षेथाम्। तेनाधिकसंस्कृतपुस्तकानि तथा प्रकाश्येरन्निति काङ्क्षा मदीया। एवं प्रकाशनं नास्ति कठिनम्।

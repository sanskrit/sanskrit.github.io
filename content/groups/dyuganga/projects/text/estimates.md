With Gemini taking care of 95%, I estimate about 5 man-minutes per page for proofreading. So 12 pages per man-hour.

Actual, unique, published Sanskrit literature is about 100-200K pages if you only look at the mula text. This figure increases manifold if you add variant readings, translations and commentaries in other languages etc. I have not included the content of the 50m pandulipis (Debroy's figure from some speech of his) in this.

Let's correct for underestimates and make it 3x. So 600K pages. That is 50K man-hours to proofread all of Sanskrit literature. With 10 people sparing 2 hours a week (about 100/y), it can be done in 50 years. Get more people involved and get them to allot an hour a day and you are looking at 3-5 years rather than 50.

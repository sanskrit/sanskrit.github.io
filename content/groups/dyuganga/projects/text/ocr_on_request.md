## What is the workflow for an OCR volunteer?
- First off - you should have access to OCR technology, and you should be willing to (learn to) use it.
- Look for requests on [the issues page](https://github.com/sanskrit/raw_etexts/issues).
- Assign a request to yourself and work on it.
- Once you get the OCR-ed text, we need to pass it on to proof-reading and to early users/ readers.
    - So initially, store the result in a separate folder in github repo such as [sanskrit/raw_etexts](https://github.com/sanskrit/raw_etexts).
    - Please include terms a person searching on an internet search engine may use.
        - Transliterate the title into the appropriate scripts.
        - Use '-' to separate terms in a samAsa. Eg. कुलार्णव-तन्त्रम् kulArNava-tantram
- Announce the fact that you've OCR-ed the file on places such as samskrita@googlegroups and sanskrit-ocr@googlegroups.

## Why be an OCR volunteer?

- You will be helping many other knowledge-lovers. (see "[why digitize]()?" section here.)
- You will have the satisfaction of putting your technical skills and time to good use.

## Trello
- I must have sent out email invites to join https://trello.com/ocrcorrection . (We use trello for tracking tasks.) Please accept (contact me if you haven't received an invite).
- Everyone needs to have a github account (We use github for checking and accepting corrections - example here) and join https://github.com/orgs/vishvAsa/teams/ocr-correction/ . Please create a github account and let me know offline so that I can send you an email invite to join https://github.com/orgs/vishvAsa/teams/ocr-correction/ .

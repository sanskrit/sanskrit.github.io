## Goal
This project aims to convince **dvija**-s  
to transition to Indian villages soon and prepare;  
and support them in doing so.  
dvija-s have been the **backbone of Hindu civilization**;  
it is by their power and obstinacy that Gods, sages and ancestors continue to be honored (even by the wider society) in India.  
They brought beauty and harmony of the highest order, and can continue to do so.

By dvija-s we not only mean **brAhmaNa-s, kShatriya-s, vaishya-s**;  
and also **sat-shUdra**-s who **reject victimhood & quota ideology** of the dasyus -  
and perhaps want to **ennoble** themselves to the victorious and beautiful dharma of the Aryas -  
even to the extent of being de-jure (rather than just de-facto) vaishya-s  
(rather than forcing dvija-s to lose their saMskAra-s and aptitude out).

## Background
In India, we observe the below:

- dense population.
- Famine + war looming post-oil-collapse (150 yrs, +100 if ice methane works). (Ref- [Murphy](https://escholarship.org/uc/energy_ambitions) )
- ब्रह्म-द्विट्-प्रभुत्वम्, jAti-woke-ism, sickular government.

A huge fraction of dvija-s and high IQ/ high-saMskAra communities  
have **migrated out** to cities (and abroad),  
with almost very few people left in rural areas  
to conserve - alongside modern science - religion, noble Hindu ideals,  
and revive, when circumstances are right, a noble society,  
alongside respect for pure ability (and not quota-ism).  

When famine hits, such city people be in a **worse position** relative to rural people -  
lands and harvest snatched, jihadists and bandits etc..  
Beyond the negative impact on themselves,  
it will be **terrible for society** as a whole  
due to the accompanying loss of knowledge and specialized ability;  
leaving it vulnerable to terrible decay and obliteration.

It would be a shame for Hindu India to turn into modern gandhAra, Afghanistan or (post-ethnic cleansing) kAshmIr.  
We (whether as individuals or civilizations) should,  
strive for **noble aging and death** (which themselves are inevitable).

## Recruitment
- Must give talks in schools, maThas etc..

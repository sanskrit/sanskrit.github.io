## Background
In India, we observe the below:

- dense population.
- Famine + war looming post-oil-collapse (150 yrs, +100 if ice methane works). (Ref- [Murphy](https://escholarship.org/uc/energy_ambitions) )
- ब्रह्म-द्विट्-प्रभुत्वम्, jAti-woke-ism, sickular government.

A huge fraction of dvija-s and high IQ/ high-saMskAra communities  
have migrated out to cities (and abroad),  
with almost very few people left in rural areas  
to conserve - alongside modern science - religion, noble Hindu ideals,  
and revive, when circumstances are right, a noble society,  
alongside respect for pure ability (and not quota-ism).  

When famine hits, such city people be in a worse (though not hopeless) position relative to rural people -  
lands and harvest snatched, jihadists and bandits etc..  
Beyond the negative impact on themselves,  
it will be terrible for society as a whole  
due to the accompanying loss of knowledge and specialized ability;  
leaving it vulnerable to terrible decay and obliteration.

It would be a shame for Hindu India to turn into modern gandhAra, Afghanistan or (post-ethnic cleansing) kAshmIr.  
We (whether as individuals or civilizations) should,  
strive for noble aging and death.

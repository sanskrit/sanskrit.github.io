## Goal
This project aims to convince traditional Hindu cultural elite, particularly **dvija**-s  
to transition to Indian villages soon and prepare;  
and support them in doing so.  
dvija-s have been the **backbone of Hindu civilization**;  
it is by their power and obstinacy that Gods, sages and ancestors continue to be adored (even by the wider society) in India.  
They brought beauty and harmony of the highest order, and can continue to do so.

By dvija-s we not only mean **brAhmaNa-s, kShatriya-s, vaishya-s**;  
and also **sat-shUdra**-s who, 

- subscribe to the victorious and beautiful dharma of the Aryas,  
- are confident in their self-worth and contribution to high civilization,  
- **reject victimhood & quota ideology** of the dasyus,  
- like trans-generational and communal refinement, 
- are pro-dvija-s, even as good dvija-s are pro-sat-shUdra-s,  
- and (far from forcing dvija-s to lose their saMskAra-s and aptitude)  
  perhaps want to **ennoble** themselves to being de-jure (rather than just de-facto) dvija-s .

## Background
In India, we observe the below:

- dense population.
- Famine + war looming post-oil-collapse (150 yrs, +100 if ice methane works). (Ref- [Murphy](https://escholarship.org/uc/energy_ambitions) )
- ब्रह्म-द्विट्-प्रभुत्वम्, jAti-woke-ism, sickular government.

A huge fraction of dvija-s and high IQ/ high-saMskAra communities  
have **migrated out** to cities (and abroad),  
with few members left in rural areas  
to conserve - alongside modern science - religion, noble Hindu ideals,  
and revive, when circumstances are right, a noble, harmonious and better organized society.  

When famine hits, such city people be in a **worse position** relative to rural people -  
there will be lands and harvest snatched, jihadists and bandits etc..  
Beyond the negative impact on themselves,  
it will be **terrible for society** as a whole  
due to the accompanying loss of knowledge and specialized ability;  
leaving it vulnerable to ugly decay and obliteration.

It would be a **shame** for Hindu India to turn into modern gandhAra, **Afghanistan** or (post-ethnic cleansing) **kAshmIr**.  
We (whether as individuals or civilizations) should,  
strive for **noble aging and death** (which themselves are inevitable).

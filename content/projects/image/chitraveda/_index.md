## Introduction

### Aim

To publish for free the entire Rg veda samhitā pāṭha along with the pada-pāṭha in comic form (with the pictures depicting the most literal/ abhidhā meaning from Sāyaṇa’s commentary). An example page is here ([4.3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kVBnotQyRnozAEmbRGG1Te3jeskORfC3icbA0Iz49Tw/pub)) (PS: We are yet to fix some errors in illustrations).   
  

ध्येयम् \- अखिलमपि ऋग्वेदसंहितापाठं पदपाठान्वितं सायणोक्तभावार्थसूचकचित्रैस् सह comic-इव मुक्तरीत्या प्रकाशयामेति, बालाकर्षणाय च पारायणे भावचोदनाय च।   

### Purpose (प्रयोजनम्)

- For the attraction of young minds towards the veda-s
- to spur the appropriate sentiment during recitation (either casually or as part of various karma-s).
- There are several secondary effects of this, not least of which is the reinvigoration of the heroic vedic thought among Hindu-s in an age which needs it the most. If our purohita-s and their yajamāna-s only understood the meaning of what they are chanting, they would be a far more valiant and nobler people. We have no doubt about this.

### Time required

At the rate of 3 pictures per day, 10000+ Rks will require 10 years of daily artistic contribution. A roughly equal amount of time contribution is required for preparing story-boards for the artist.
